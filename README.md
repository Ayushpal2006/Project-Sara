## üìñ About the Project

**Project Sora** is an AI-driven personal assistant designed to **index, search, and analyze your local files intelligently**. Built with scalability in mind, it uses asynchronous Python to efficiently crawl through directories and create a searchable metadata index ‚Äî all locally, no data leaves your machine.

Think of it as the **foundation of a smart local AI assistant**: capable of understanding your file system, ready to be extended with natural language search, LLM integrations, and even a web interface.

This project follows **production-grade coding practices**:
- Modular design
- Async-first approach
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive logging
- Future extensibility with LangChain & OpenAI

## ‚ú® Features

- üìÇ **Smart File Indexing**  
  Crawl multiple directories and build a structured index of all files with metadata (name, path, extension).

- ‚ö° **Asynchronous Processing**  
  Uses `asyncio` and non-blocking I/O for high performance, even on large file systems.

- üîç **Fast & Flexible Search**  
  Filter files by name, type, path, or size ‚Äî optimized for quick retrieval.

- üß† **AI-Ready Architecture**  
  Designed for seamless integration with **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, or any LLM pipeline.

- üìä **Built-in Logging System**  
  Every operation is logged with timestamps and status levels (`INFO`, `ERROR`, etc.) for debugging and monitoring.

- üöÄ **Production-Grade Structure**  
  Modular codebase: easy to extend, test, and maintain.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

| Category        | Technology Used                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Language        | Python 3.10+                             |
| Async Framework | `asyncio`, `os`                          |
| File Handling   | `pathlib`, `os.walk`                     |
| Logging         | `logging` module                         |
| Future Tools    | LangChain, OpenAI API, FastAPI (planned) |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayushpal2006/Project-Sora.git
cd Project-Sora
```

## üîß 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

## 3. Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
## 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 5. Run the Project
```bash
python main.py
```
# üìÇ Folder Structure
| Path               | Type  | Description                                      |
|--------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `main.py`          | File  | Entry point ‚Äì runs the indexing process         |
| `indexer.py`       | File  | Core logic: async file crawling & metadata extraction |
| `utils/`           | Folder| Contains utility modules                          |
| `utils/logger.py`  | File  | Centralized logging setup (file + console handlers) |
| `utils/helpers.py` | File  | Helper functions (e.g., `get_file_size`, `get_extension`) |
| `logs/`            | Folder| Stores log files (created at runtime)            |
| `logs/app.log`     | File  | Auto-generated application log file              |
| `requirements.txt` | File  | List of Python dependencies                      |
| `README.md`        | File  | Project documentation and guide                  |
| `.gitignore`       | File  | Specifies files to exclude from version control  |

## üí° Why This Project Stands Out?

### ‚úÖ Uses real async programming, not just sync code with async keyword
### ‚úÖ Production-grade structure: separate modules, logging, error handling
### ‚úÖ Scalable design ‚Äî easy to plug in AI, web APIs, DBs
